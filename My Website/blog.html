              <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
              <p>
                   Certificate programs are available in specialized technical fields; 
                  they usually include little to no formal coursework, and instead focus on 
                  practicum (or hands-on) training. Professions that may earn certification include 
                  plumbers, automotive mechanics, electricians, IT managers, paralegals, and healthcare administrators. 
                  Certifications are also widely available in different areas of business management and administration. 
                  In most cases, the only prerequisite for a certificate will be a high school diploma or GED. 
                  Certificates generally span 20 to 30 credits in length, and most can be earned within one academic year or less.
              </p>

                  Online diplomas and certificates are aimed at students with busy weekly schedules who prefer to study on their own time. 
                  Current learning technology allows students to study away from their home computer using a laptop, tablet, smartphone, and 
                  other portable devices with Wi-Fi accessibility. Online programs decrease (if not eliminate) overhead costs related 
                  to commuting and parking, meals, and living accommodations
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                  Certificates may include anywhere from three to 10 courses, and typically span 10 to 30 credits in length; 
                  most can be completed in one year or less. Diplomas, on the other hand, generally include 10 to 25 courses; 
                  most require between one and two years for completion. However, some schools offer certificates and diplomas 
                  that can be earned in as little as one semester or quarter. The length of a certificate or diploma program will 
                  largely depend on the subject or field of study. Subjects that have a broader scope — such as nursing, 
                  IT management, or dental assistant — will usually require a longer time commitment than specialized subjects 
                  like medical billing and coding, automotive mechanics, or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).

                Students who pursue an online certificate program or college diploma program stand to save money compared to 
                their brick-and-mortar counterparts. A recent survey from WCET noted that 75% of all online courses offered 
                in the U.S. are priced at the same tuition rate as on-campus courses. Additionally, 53.6% of survey respondents 
                noted that students who enrolled completely online are not required to pay all of the fees assessed to 
                brick-and-mortar learners. However, other factors may drive up the cost of earning a certificate or diploma online. 
                One of these factors is state residency; a large number of two- and four-year postsecondary institutions level 
                higher tuition rates for students who are not state residents.
